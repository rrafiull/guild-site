# About the Functional QE Practice

### Practice Vision & Objectives
Our vision is to embed quality into the heart of the development lifecycle. We aim to:
* **Standardise:** Align all teams on a unified definition of "Ready" and "Done."
* **Accelerate:** Provide the tools and frameworks that reduce "Time to Market."
* **Innovate:** Stay at the forefront of testing technology and methodology.

---

### Relationship to Non-Functional QE
While we focus on **Functional** requirements (Business logic, UI, API flow), we work in lockstep with the **Non-Functional Practice** (Performance, Security, Reliability).
* **Handshake:** We define *what* the system does; they ensure it does it *stably and safely*.
* **Collaboration:** We share core assets, such as environment configurations and data masking tools.

---

### Operating Model (Guild-Based)
We operate on a **Guild Model** to ensure knowledge isn't siloed. 
* **Practice:** Sets the global standards and career paths.
* **Guilds:** Specialized technical communities (UI, Backend, Management) that drive innovation and peer review.

### Engagement Models
We support project teams through three primary models:

| Model | Description | Best For... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Embedded** | QE specialists join a squad as a core member. | Long-term product delivery. |
| **Managed Service** | An end-to-end testing team manages a specific output. | Large scale migrations or legacy systems. |
| **Advisory** | High-level consulting and architectural reviews. | Project startup or process troubleshooting. |

### Practice Leadership Structure
The practice is led by a core team responsible for strategy, while Guild Leads drive technical execution.

* **Strategic Direction:** Nimesh Patel (Head of QE)
* **Pillar Leads:** Deepak Garcha (Non-Functional), Elizabeth Jones & Shaun Clark (Functional)
